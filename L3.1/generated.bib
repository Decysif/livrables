  abstract = {Reasoning about imperative programs requires the
                 ability to track aliasing and ownership properties. We
                 present a type system that provides this ability, by
                 using regions, capabilities, and singleton types. It is
                 designed for a high-level calculus with higher-order
                 functions, algebraic data structures, and references
                 (mutable memory cells). The type system has
                 polymorphism, yet does not require a value restriction,
                 because capabilities act as explicit store typings.\par
                 We exhibit a type-directed, type-preserving, and
                 meaning-preserving translation of this imperative
                 calculus into a pure calculus. Like the monadic
                 translation, this is a store-passing translation. Here,
                 however, the store is partitioned into multiple
                 fragments, which are threaded through a computation
                 only if they are relevant to it. Furthermore, the
                 decomposition of the store into fragments can evolve
                 dynamically to reflect ownership transfers.\par The
                 translation offers deep insight about the inner
                 workings and soundness of the type system. If coupled
                 with a semantic model of its target calculus, it leads
                 to a semantic model of its imperative source calculus.
                 Furthermore, it provides a foundation for our long-term
                 objective of designing a system for specifying and
                 certifying imperative programs with dynamic memory
                 allocation.}

The current CHC-based methods for pointer-manipulating programs, however, are not very scalable. This paper proposes a novel translation of pointer-manipulating Rust programs into CHCs, which clears away pointers and heaps by leveraging ownership. We formalize the translation for a simplified core of Rust and prove its correctness. We have implemented a prototype verifier for a subset of Rust and confirmed the effectiveness of our method.},

  title = {A Pragmatic Type System for Deductive Verification},

  institution = {Universit\'e Paris Sud},
  year = 2016,
  abstract = { In the context of deductive verication, it is customary
                  today to handle programs with pointers using either
                  separation logic, dynamic frames, or explicit memory
                  models. Yet we can observe that in numerous
                  programs, a large amount of code ts within the scope
                  of Hoare logic, provided we can statically control
                  aliasing. When this is the case, the code
                  correctness can be reduced to simpler verication
                  conditions which do not require any explicit memory
                  model. This makes verication conditions more
                  amenable both to automated theorem proving and to
                  manual inspection and debugging. In this paper, we
                  devise a method of such static aliasing control for
                  a programming language featuring nested data
                  structures with mutable components. Our solution is
                  based on a type system with singleton regions and
                  eects, which we prove to be sound.},
